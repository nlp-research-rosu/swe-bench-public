# sympy__sympy-24066 — FVK analysis

- **Verdict:** C_ROBUSTNESS — fvk wraps the new `DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless`/`equivalent_dims` calls in `try/except TypeError`, which (a) repairs a regression baseline itself introduced and (b) prevents an uncaught `TypeError` that even the human gold fix still has.
- **Pitch-worthiness (1-5):** 4

## The issue
`SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` raised on expressions whose dimension can't be analyzed (e.g. transcendental functions of dimensionful quantities). The gold fix normalizes a dimensionless function argument's dimension to `Dimension(1)` in the `Function` branch.

## What baseline did
Baseline generalized the `Add` branch to use `equivalent_dims(...)` and called `is_dimensionless(...)`/`equivalent_dims(...)` **inline with no guard**. `DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless`/`equivalent_dims` genuinely raise `TypeError` on un-analyzable symbolic dimensions (e.g. `Dimension(sin(length))`). So for an incompatible addend carrying an un-analyzable dimension, baseline turns a clean `ValueError` (orig/gold behavior) into a confusing low-level `TypeError` — a regression.

## What fvk changed and why
fvk extracted `_is_dimensionless`/`_dimensions_equivalent` helpers that wrap those calls in `try/except TypeError`, treating an un-analyzable dimension as "not dimensionless"/"not equivalent". This restores the correct `ValueError` in the `Add` branch and avoids an uncaught `TypeError` in the `Function` branch.

## Concrete demonstration (executed, sympy 1.11.1 — exact pre-fix version)
```python
# Q is a quantity whose dimension is Dimension(sin(length))  (un-analyzable)
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(meter + Q)     # incompatible add
```
| variant | result |
|---|---|
| original / gold | `ValueError` (clean, "incompatible dimensions") |
| **baseline** | **uncaught `TypeError`** ← regression |
| **fvk** | `ValueError` ✅ (matches original/gold) |

Also `exp(Q)` with the same dimension: baseline **and gold** raise `TypeError`; **fvk** returns `(E, Dimension(sin(length)))` — fvk is more robust than gold on that path.

## Why the tests missed it
The FAIL_TO_PASS exercises the reported transcendental-of-dimensionless case (which gold's Function-branch normalization handles). No test passes an un-analyzable dimension into the `Add` branch, so baseline's `TypeError` regression is never triggered by the suite.

## Gold comparison
Gold only patches the `Function` branch and shares the Function-branch `TypeError` crash on un-analyzable dims; it never touches the `Add` branch. fvk's try/except wrapping is a superset. **GOLD_MATCH: partial.**

## Confidence & caveats
- **High confidence:** all variants executed on the exact buggy version; baseline's `TypeError` vs fvk's `ValueError` confirmed.
- These are un-analyzable/edge dimension inputs, not everyday usage — but baseline genuinely regressed the error type, and fvk fixed it.
